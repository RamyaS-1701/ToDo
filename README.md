# ToDo
A To-Do List is a tool that helps users organize and manage tasks they need to complete. It is commonly used to keep track of personal, academic, or work-related activities.  Users can add, edit, mark as complete, or delete tasks as needed. A to-do list improves productivity, reduces stress, and ensures that important tasks are not forgotten.
